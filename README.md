I chose to use the GNU general public license v3.0 because, in class, we talked about the GNU project and the importance of free software.  Free software is computer software that users can run as well as study, change, and distribute and adapt it to create their own versions.  However, with the GNU general public license, users may use, modify, and distribute the software, but ONLY if they apply the same agreement of making their derivative software usable, modifable, and distributable.  This concept is known as "copyleft," where there are restrictions that limit a program's use and free distribution.  By making my programs copylefted, users can change and use them for innovative purposes, but will keep them open source to others so they too can innovate with them.
